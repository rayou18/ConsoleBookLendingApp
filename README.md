This project demonstrates
- A simple integration to an API.
- Use of dependency injection.
- Use of datastructures.
- Input validation and error handling.
- Segretion of interfaces as well as whole projects.

the application targets net8.0.

------------------------------
aditional thoughts:
 - Even though it is beyond the task I have spend some time segrating
 the projects etc. in order to show you how I would normally arrange my code. 

 - I am aware that I could have used an auto mapper instead of a manual mapping approach.
 
 - As the task description did not state unit/integration tests as a requirement I did not add any.
Had this been a real task I would of cause have added tests.
